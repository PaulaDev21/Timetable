# timetable
Extracting a specific timetable from a messy excel database with Python. 

So, my son is at the University, yey! He was showing me a awful, messy excel file, from which he was supposed to extract the timetable for all his classes. I thought it would be an interesting, simple and useful exercise of manipulating some excel with Python. 

Then I realized it was not excel, but csv. Still a good practice for selecting, analyzing and organizing data.
